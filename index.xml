      <description>PaaS (Platform as a Service) is changing the way of how we build production ready software in a much faster and simpler way. Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) is a major commercial version of open source Cloud Foundry. As part of this post, I have take a sample spring boot application and deploying the same to PCF via CLI. The demo application has two REST api end point /addTask and /fetchTasks for adding a new task to ToDo and fetch all the ToDo tasks.</description>

      <description>Collaborative coding is one of the key component to build better software. Open source software like GitHub, is a community of 25 million members maintains their code and projects on the cloud.
The question is - How can we manage our Data Science projects on the cloud, so that we can execute anywhere, anytime and can support cloning, sharing etc.. Jupyter notebook (previously iPython Notebook) is a popular open-source platform for doing Data Science, however for the local development the complete Data Science package including Jupyter can be downloaded from Anaconda distribution, which is local development.</description>
